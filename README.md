#Flash Card project

## Project Description

My app is called Star Wars Flash Cards. I designed this game for people like myself who are Star Wars enthusiasts who would like to test their knowledge. This is meant to be played as a single player game. I would like to add a button where the player can get a hint, another feature where some common wrong answers are displayed after clicking to see the result, and i would like to have images attached to the answers as well. I want the app to be easy to use, so that when the user clicks the question the card will display the answer. This may discourage people from copy/pasting into a search engine.
